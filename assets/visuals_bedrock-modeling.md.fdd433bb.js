This is because the size of cubes is floored for the UV map calculation. This means that any size smaller than 1 will result in a 0 pixel wide UV map, which will look glitchy. To prevent this, make sure all of your cubes are at least 1 unit long in each direction. To create smaller cubes, use the Inflate slider. Another trick to solve this if you <em>must</em> have smaller textures is by <strong>increasing the element size by 1 in each direction</strong> and then <strong>inflating the element by -1</strong> though note that this will make you have smaller pixels textured incorrectly will lead to mixels.</p><h2 id="vertex-snap" tabindex="-1">Vertex Snap <a class="header-anchor" href="#vertex-snap" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Vertex snap is a handy tool in blockbench any modeler should use. It&#39;s beneficial when doing rounded things like wheels. You can find this tool right top next to the movement &amp; scale tools. It has 2 modes, Move &amp; Scale. How this tool works can be seen in the following gif. <img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="transparency" tabindex="-1">Transparency <a class="header-anchor" href="#transparency" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>If you use semi-transparent textures (like colored glass), you need to move elements with that texture to the bottom of the element list. Otherwise, elements behind these semi-transparent ones won&#39;t render in-game.</p><h2 id="texturing" tabindex="-1">Texturing <a class="header-anchor" href="#texturing" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>When learning to texture, your best bet is practicing with references on how others textured similar objects &amp; surfaces. Patterns for wood &amp; metal are different, and you should consider that. Good guides are <a href="https://www.blockbench.net/wiki/guides/minecraft-style-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Masteriano&#39;s Texturing Tips</a> and in general, any on pixel art.</p><h2 id="materials" tabindex="-1">Materials <a class="header-anchor" href="#materials" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Whether or no the transparency or emissive textures in your models work in-game, it&#39;s decided by the materials applied to them.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Material</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>entity</td><td>basic opaque material</td></tr><tr><td>entity_alphatest</td><td>supports transparent pixels</td></tr><tr><td>entity_alphablend</td><td>supports translucent pixels</td></tr><tr><td>entity_emissive</td><td>solid, alpha channel is used as the emissive channel</td></tr><tr><td>entity_emissive_alpha</td><td>alpha channel is used for emissiveness, completely black + transparent pixels are rendered transparently</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="z-fighting" tabindex="-1">Z-fighting <a class="header-anchor" href="#z-fighting" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Z-fighting is called when you have the face of 2 elements in the same place, and you can see both or half of them at the same time, as seen in the following picture. <img src="'+c+'" alt=""> You can solve this by inflating one of them by <code>0.01</code> or <code>-0.01</code> depending on which one should prioritize.</p><h2 id="basics-of-animations" tabindex="-1">Basics of Animations <a class="header-anchor" href="#basics-of-animations" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>When animating in Blockbench, you can set each keyframe by hand, or you can use variables &amp; functions.
