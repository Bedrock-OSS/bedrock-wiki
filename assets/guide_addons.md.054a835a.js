Your imagination is the limit!</p><p>Addons are primarily written in <a href="./understanding-json.html">json</a>, which is a structured data-format.

These packs can communicate with or will require each other for them to function properly, in the sense that assets defined in one can be accessed in the other. For example, when creating a custom entity, you need two files:</p><ul><li>An RP entity definition, which describes how your entity will <em>look</em></li><li>A BP entity definition, which describes how your entity will <em>act</em></li></ul><h2 id="what-you-have-learned" tabindex="-1">What you have learned <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-you-have-learned" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><ul><li>Addons modify Minecraft content or add their own</li><li>Addons are written in json</li><li>An addon is split into the <strong>Resource Pack</strong> and the <strong>Behavior Pack</strong>: - Resource Packs contain Textures, Sounds, ... and control how the game looks - Behavior Packs contain entity-files, crafting recipes, ... and control the logic of your game</li></ul></div><h2 id="what-to-do-now" tabindex="-1">What to do now? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-to-do-now" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>',17);function h(u,m,p,w,k,f){const e=r("BButton");return s(),t("div",null,[l,o(e,{link:"/guide/software-preparation.html",color:"blue"},{default:i(()=>[c("Check out software and preparation page!")]),_:1})])}const g=a(d,[["render",h]]);export{v as __pageData,g as default};
