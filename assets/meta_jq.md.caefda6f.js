It can be thought of similarly to Perl. Because it was explicitly written to parse JSON, however, it has many valuable features that are not present in other text processors. jq defines its programs as filters, as they take an input, your JSON data, and produce an output, your modified JSON data. Though seemingly simple, jq contains many advanced features that can be extremely useful when procedurally generating addon files.</p><p>I&#39;ll be explaining jq from the perspective that jq is a command-line interface. However, wrappers have been designed for jq in essentially every programming language, so you can easily incorporate jq filters into the programing language of your choice, including Go, JavaScript, Java, Ruby, Python, and R. Given that, I will primarily focus on filter design from the perspective of Minecraft addons, and I&#39;ll leave the implementation to your specific use case.

Now, I&#39;d like to go over an example of a practical use case of jq. I&#39;ll be explaining the jq filter I wrote for converting a Java model to a Bedrock model for use as an attachable while remapping all its UV values.</p><p>First, we&#39;ll define a simple variable to change the name of our model geometry easily. Next, we&#39;ll define a function to deal with our elements, <code>element_array</code>. We&#39;ll first get some information from the array of textures from our Java model to know how many textures we have, what order they&#39;re in, and therefore how to shift our UV values. Now that we&#39;ve defined all our variables from our texture array, which we&#39;ll use later in UV calculations, we&#39;ll start to map our elements array.</p><p>Iterating through each element in our array of elements, we&#39;ll calculate our origin and size. We can use simple math from jq to do this. To go from Java to Bedrock, we&#39;ll need to change 2 absolute corner positions to one origin value and one size value. We&#39;ll also shift our X and Z coordinates by 8 to account for the different centering of coordinate systems between Bedrock and Java.</p><p>Now, we&#39;ll deal with rotation. The way Java defines its rotations uses a string followed by a value, but we&#39;d like to construct an array based on that. We can do so with a reasonably simple if, then, else statement. Since rotation is optional, we&#39;ll just set that to null for now if we don&#39;t have a rotation. We can delete that later. Next, we&#39;ll set the element pivot, shifting by 8 on the X and Z due to the coordinate difference and setting to null if we lack a pivot.</p><p>We will then calculate our UV values. I wish to shift all our UV&#39;s as if we are generating a single square texture atlas from our input textures. We&#39;ll define a nested function, <code>uv_calc</code>, here. We&#39;ll then use some modular division via the <code>fmod</code> function to figure out the offsets. Finally, we&#39;ll change Java&#39;s four coordinate style UV system to Bedrock&#39;s, which uses a point value and a size value, with simple arithmetic. We&#39;ll then run the function for each of the six faces of our element, and finally, use <code>walk</code> to remove any objects with the value null.</p><p>To make our geometry compatible with custom blocks, we&#39;ll define the function <code>pivot_groups</code>, which we&#39;ll ultimately use to iterate over our element array, find all unique rotation pivot combinations, and create a bone for all elements that share a rotation-pivot variety.</p><p>Lastly, we&#39;ll put down the structure of our actual geometry file. We&#39;ll concatenate in our model name, use our <code>element_array</code> function to bring in all our cubes with no rotation, and add in our special pivot groups. We&#39;ll use the map to give each group a unique name, iterating up one value each time.</p><p>This filter is a little heavy, so I&#39;ve linked it on a separate page rather than embedding it <a
