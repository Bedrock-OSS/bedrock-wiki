Addons are very powerful and allow us to create custom entities, items, and blocks, as well as things like custom loot tables and crafting recipes. Your imagination is the limit!</p><p>Addons are primarily written in <a href="./understanding-json.html">json</a>, which is a structured data-format. An addon is essentially a collection of json files, images, and sounds, which modify or add to the game in some way.</p><h2 id="behavior-pack-vs-resource-pack" tabindex="-1">Behavior Pack Vs. Resource Pack <a class="header-anchor" href="#behavior-pack-vs-resource-pack" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Addons are split into two pack types: Resource Packs, and Behavior Packs. Both can function independently, but they are most commonly used together. When you have both a Resource Pack and Behavior Pack, this is referred to as an <em>addon</em>.</p><h3 id="resource-pack" tabindex="-1">Resource Pack <a class="header-anchor" href="#resource-pack" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The Resource Pack, also known as the <em>client</em>, or RP, is responsible for the <em>visuals</em> and <em>sounds</em> in your addon. This includes things like:</p><ul><li>Textures</li><li>Sounds</li><li>Geometry</li><li>Animations</li><li>Particles</li></ul><h3 id="behavior-pack" tabindex="-1">Behavior Pack <a class="header-anchor" href="#behavior-pack" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The Behavior Pack, also known as the <em>server</em>, or BP, is responsible for the <em>logic</em> of your addon. This can include things like:</p><ul><li>How your entity acts</li><li>Crafting recipes</li><li>Loot tables</li><li>Custom functions</li></ul><h3 id="communication-between-packs" tabindex="-1">Communication between packs <a class="header-anchor" href="#communication-between-packs" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>In most cases, you will have both a RP and a BP together. These packs can communicate with each other, in the sense that assets defined in one can be accessed in the other. For example, when creating a custom entity, you need two files:</p><ul><li>An RP entity definition, which describes how your entity will <em>look</em></li><li>A BP entity definition, which describes how your entity will <em>act</em></li></ul><h2 id="what-you-have-learned" tabindex="-1">What you have learned <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-you-have-learned" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">What you have learned:</p><ul><li>Addons modify Minecraft content or add their own</li><li>Addons are written in json</li><li>An addon is split into the <strong>Resource Pack</strong> and the <strong>Behavior Pack</strong>: - Resource Packs contain Textures, Sounds, ... and control how the game looks - Behavior Packs contain entity-files, crafting recipes, ... and control the logic of your game</li></ul></div><h2 id="what-to-do-now" tabindex="-1">What to do now? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-to-do-now" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>',17),h=c("Check out software and preparation page!");function u(m,p,k,w,f,v){const e=s("BButton");return r(),o("div",null,[l,t(e,{link:"/guide/software-preparation.html",color:"blue"},{default:i(()=>[h]),_:1})])}var b=a(d,[["render",u]]);export{y as __pageData,b as default};
