We read number 10 and that means we will read compoud. We also know that we are at the root element property of this file now, so we need to read the name of our root element property. Name is string, so first we have to read the length of the text in bytes, and that is written by Int16 <em>(Short)</em>.</p><p><img src="'+h+'" alt=""></p><p>The name size of our root element property is zero so we won&#39;t read any more bytes. We don&#39;t know what to read, so let&#39;s read another byte.</p><p><img src="'+m+'" alt=""></p><p>We already know that the next property in our root compound is type of string, but before we read our property value, we first read its name written such as string. So we read another 2 bytes to get the length of the string name from of our property.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>We see that length of property name, it is 6 bytes long. So let&#39;s read the next 6 bytes.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>So we have read the Name of our property, which we can get in text form using UTF-8 encoding, that is: <code>myText</code>, then remember that the type of our property is string, so we repeat the process. I&#39;ll read the next Int16 (2 bytes) again and we&#39;ll find out the length of our string value.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p>The string length of our property is 0x0B, so 11, so read another 11 bytes.</p><p><img src="'+_+'" alt=""></p><p>When we push our read bytes through UTF-8 encoding, it again returns the value: <code>My NBT text</code>, what now? You don&#39;t know? So read the next byte to find out what to do next.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p><p>So we read type 3, the 3 type is Int16 which contains 4 bytes. But before we read our number We have to find out the name of this property again. So? Read an Int32 to get the length of the name for this property.</p><p><img src="'+y+'" alt=""></p><p>So we know the length of the name 0x0f (15), Let&#39;s read the next 15 bytes and push it through UTF-8 encoding.</p><p><img src="'+b+'" alt=""></p><p>Now we have the name of this property: <code>my Int32 Number</code>. Next let&#39;s read that Int32 =&gt; 4 bytes.</p><p><img src="'+f+'" alt=""></p><p>We read an Int32 that has the value <code>0x01c8</code> (456). Again You don&#39;t know what to do next? Then just read another type of next property, so? 1 byte.</p><p><img src="'+w+'" alt=""></p><p>We read 0x00 (an empty byte), and that marks the end of the root compound.
