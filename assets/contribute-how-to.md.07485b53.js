While it is possible to edit the wiki &quot;in-place&quot; on the github website, this guide will instead teach you the proper technique. This is a valuable and transferable skill, and will set you up for additional knowledge beyond just editing the wiki.</p><p>This article will teach you how to use GitHub Desktop, the easiest way to manage your local Repositories. Its possible to do this without GitHub Desktop just by using Git, but this is more advanced than just using GitHub Desktop and we won&#39;t be covering this in this guide.</p><p>If you already know some of the steps we cover in this guide, feel free to use the Table of Contents on the right side to skip to the sections you don&#39;t know!</p><p>And if you want to learn more about our fancy styling-features, continue with our <a href="/contribute-style.html">Contribute-Style-Guide</a>!</p><h2 id="steps-to-edit-the-wiki" tabindex="-1">Steps to edit the wiki <a class="header-anchor" href="#steps-to-edit-the-wiki" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>To edit the wiki, there are 5 major steps that you need to follow (downloading and setting up the software is just done the first time):</p><ol><li>Fork the Repository</li><li>Clone the Repository</li><li>Edit the Wiki</li><li>Commit your local changes and sync with GitHub</li><li>Create a Pull Request</li></ol><p>If you see this the first time, it might look a little overwhelming, but don&#39;t worry!

Just follow the steps below:</p><p>Open our <a href="https://github.com/Bedrock-OSS/bedrock-wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GitHub Repository</a> and click on <code>Fork</code>.

To work on it, just click on &quot;Open in Visual Studio Code&quot;. VSCode will automatically open with our wiki. If VSCode asks you if it should trust the folder, just click on <code>Yes, I trust the authors</code>.</p><p><img src="'+k+'" alt=""></p><p>Now you have successfully cloned the wiki to your local device and you can edit all files!</p><h2 id="committing-your-changes" tabindex="-1">Committing your changes <a class="header-anchor" href="#committing-your-changes" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Once you finished working on the wiki, you can now commit and push your changes directly to our repository!</p><p>Switch to GitHub Desktop and you should see your changes. If you can&#39;t see them, make sure you saved your files and opened the right repository in GitHub Desktop.</p><p>Once you confirmed your changes in GitHub Desktop, you can give your commit a name and a description (but both aren&#39;t necessary) and click on <code>commit to main</code>.</p><p><img src="'+v+'" alt=""></p><p>After you committed your changes, you need to push your local clone to GitHub.

To update your local clone, you need to update your fork. Don&#39;t worry, its really easy!</p><p>With GitHub opened in your browser, open your fork. You will see a field that shows you, that you are out of date.

After that, you can&#39;t just pull the changes to your local clone in GitHub Desktop, because this would cause problems.
