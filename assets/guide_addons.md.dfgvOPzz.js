Add-ons are very powerful and allow us to create custom entities, items, and blocks, as well as things like custom loot tables and crafting recipes. Your imagination is the limit!</p><p>Add-ons are primarily written in <a href="/guide/understanding-json.html">json</a>, which is a structured data-format.
