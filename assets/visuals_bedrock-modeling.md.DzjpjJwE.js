This is because the size of cubes is floored for the UV map calculation. This means that any size smaller than 1 will result in a 0 pixel wide UV map, which will look glitchy. To prevent this, make sure all of your cubes are at least 1 unit long in each direction. To create smaller cubes, use the Inflate slider. Another trick to solve this if you <em>must</em> have smaller textures is by <strong>increasing the element size by 1 in each direction</strong> and then <strong>inflating the element by -1</strong> though note that this will make you have smaller pixels textured incorrectly will lead to mixels.</p><h2 id="vertex-snap" tabindex="-1">Vertex Snap <a class="header-anchor" href="#vertex-snap" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Vertex Snap&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Vertex snap is a handy tool in blockbench any modeler should use. It&#39;s beneficial when doing rounded things like wheels. You can find this tool right top next to the movement &amp; scale tools. It has 2 modes, Move &amp; Scale. How this tool works can be seen in the following gif. <img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="transparency" tabindex="-1">Transparency <a class="header-anchor" href="#transparency" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Transparency&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you use semi-transparent textures (like colored glass), you need to move elements with that texture to the bottom of the element list.
