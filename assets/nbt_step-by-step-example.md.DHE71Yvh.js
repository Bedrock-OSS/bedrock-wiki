We read number 10 and that means we will read compoud. We also know that we are at the root element property of this file now, so we need to read the name of our root element property. Name is string, so first we have to read the length of the text in bytes, and that is written by Int16 <em>(Short)</em>.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt=""></p><p>The name size of our root element property is zero so we won&#39;t read any more bytes.

So we read another 2 bytes to get the length of the string name from of our property.</p><p><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></p><p>We see that length of property name, it is 6 bytes long. So let&#39;s read the next 6 bytes.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p><p>So we have read the Name of our property, which we can get in text form using UTF-8 encoding, that is: <code>myText</code>, then remember that the type of our property is string, so we repeat the process.

You don&#39;t know? So read the next byte to find out what to do next.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt=""></p><p>So we read type 3, the 3 type is Int16 which contains 4 bytes.

- The closing null byte does not terminate the reading of the NBT as such, but merely marks the end of the current compound.
- All the numbers you read need to be read with little-endian, See [NBT in Depth](/nbt/nbt-in-depth)>[little-endian](/nbt/nbt-in-depth#little-endian).
- The first root NBT element in a file can only be a compound or a list. The root element/property in NBT files also has its own name, even though it is mostly empty, but it still needs to be read and avoid complications.
