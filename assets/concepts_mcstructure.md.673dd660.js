To load them in game with a load structure block, the files must be placed in a behavior pack. The path determines the structure identifier, which is typed into the structure block to load the structure.</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong><br><code>myBP/structures/house.mcstructure</code> → <code>mystructure:house</code><br><code>myBP/structures/dungeon/entrance.mcstructure</code> → <code>dungeon:entrance</code><br><code>myBP/structures/stuff/towers/diamond.mcstructure</code> → <code>stuff:towers/diamond</code></p><p>The first subfolder defines the namespace, and subsequent folders define the path, ending with the structure file&#39;s name.</p><p>Note that any files directly in the <code>structures</code> folder are given the <code>mystructure</code> namespace. If a structure exists in the <code>structures</code> folder and shares a name with a structure in an explicit <code>mystructure</code> folder, the game produces the following content log warning:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>[Structure][warning]-There was a conflict loading a structure in the default namespace. A structure with name &lt;name&gt; was found in both in the root directory and the mystructure directory.\n</code></pre></div><p>In this case, the file in the <code>mystructure</code> folder is the one that &quot;wins,&quot; resulting in the file directly in the <code>structures</code> folder being ignored.</p><h3 id="file-format"><a class="header-anchor" href="#file-format" aria-hidden="true">#</a> File Format</h3><p><code>mcstructure</code> files are uncompressed <a href="https://wiki.vg/NBT#Specification" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBT files</a>. Like all Bedrock Edition NBT files, they are stored in little-endian format. The tag structure is as follows:</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOoHjFc.png" alt="Integer"> <code>format_version</code>: Currently always set to <code>1</code>.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/quP0K47.png" alt="List"> <code>size</code>: List of three integers describing the size of the structure&#39;s bounds.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOoHjFc.png" alt="Integer"> Size of the structure in the X direction.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOoHjFc.png" alt="Integer"> Size of the structure in the Y direction.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOoHjFc.png" alt="Integer"> Size of the structure in the Z direction.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GXsHWoh.png" alt="Compound"> <code>structure</code>: Actual data compound.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/quP0K47.png" alt="List"> <code>block_indices</code>: List containing two sublists, one for each layer. These contain the blocks in the structure. Each block is stored as an integer index into the palette (see below). Proceeds in ZYX order from the lowest corner to the highest one. For example, if the structure size is <code>[2,3,4]</code>, then the 24 (product of the dimensions) values in each layer list represent the blocks located at <code>[(0,0,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,2), (0,0,3), (0,1,0), (0,1,1), (0,1,2), (0,1,3), (0,2,0), (0,2,1), (0,2,2), (0,2,3), (1,0,0), (1,0,1), (1,0,2), (1,0,3), (1,1,0), (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,1,3), (1,2,0), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), (1,2,3)]</code> relative to the origin. Index values equal to <code>-1</code> indicate no block, causing any existing block to remain upon loading. This occurs when structure voids are saved, and is the case for most blocks in the second layer. Both layers share the same palette.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/quP0K47.png" alt="List"> of <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOoHjFc.png" alt="Integer"> Indices for blocks in the primary layer.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/quP0K47.png" alt="List"> of <img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOoHjFc.png" alt="Integer"> Indices for blocks in the secondary layer.

However, currently only <code>default</code> is saved and loaded.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GXsHWoh.png" alt="Compound"> A single palette (currently only named <code>default</code>).</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/quP0K47.png" alt="List"> <code>block_palette</code>: List of block states.

Examples: <code>wood_type:&quot;acacia&quot;</code>, <code>bite_counter:3</code>, <code>open_bit:1b</code>. The values are the appropriate NBT type for the state: strings for enum values, integers for scalar numbers, and bytes for boolean values.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/aOoHjFc.png" alt="Integer"> <code>version</code>: Compatibility versioning number for this block (currently <code>17825806</code> as of writing, in 1.16).</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GXsHWoh.png" alt="Compound"> <code>block_position_data</code>: Contains additional data for individual blocks in the structure. Each key is an integer index into the flattened list of blocks inside of <code>block_indices</code>. Layer is unspecified as it is irrelevant.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GXsHWoh.png" alt="Compound"> <code>&lt;index&gt;</code>: A single piece of additional block data, applied to the block at its index position.</p><blockquote><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/GXsHWoh.png" alt="Compound"> <code>block_entity_data</code>: Block entity data as NBT, stored exactly the same as block entities in the world file itself.
