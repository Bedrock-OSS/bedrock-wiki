While the syntax is now more verbose and longer to write, it allows much finer control over the contextual components of commands and adds support for conditions to commands, superseding the use of commands like <code>/testfor</code>, <code>/testforblock</code>, and <code>/testforblocks</code>.</p><p>Before we dive into the syntax and how to write it, we need to understand how the old <code>/execute</code> command worked, and what changed and why. This will make explaining the concepts found in the syntax easier.</p><h2 id="execute-and-why-it-changed" tabindex="-1">Execute, and Why it Changed <a class="header-anchor" href="#execute-and-why-it-changed" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>The <code>/execute</code> command executes a command on behalf of one or more entities. The old syntax used to be this:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>/execute &lt;target&gt; &lt;position&gt; &lt;command&gt;
/execute &lt;target&gt; &lt;position&gt; detect &lt;position&gt; &lt;block&gt; &lt;data value&gt; &lt;command&gt;
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers-wrapper"><span class="line-number">1</span><br><span class="line-number">2</span><br></div></div><p>You specified a target to execute as, then the command&#39;s context would change to run as that target, and at that target. Any positions were then relative to that target. While this is useful in most cases, it also forces the fact that a command&#39;s target and its position are always tied together (unless you were to manually insert world coordinates in place of <code>&lt;position&gt;</code>). It&#39;s also not very malleable in regards to making conditional statements, as you have to execute as an entity every time.</p><p>Back in the Summer of 2017 during the Update Aquatic&#39;s development, the developers from Minecraft: Java Edition were getting feedback from the community on how they can improve the <code>/execute</code> command&#39;s syntax, and the basic concept that was conceived is this: <code>/execute</code> takes an unlimited number of <strong>subcommands</strong> that manipulate certain aspects of the command in the order you specify, then a &quot;run&quot; subcommand is placed at the end to fire a command. This allows for much greater control for what <code>/execute</code> can do to a command, and allows splitting up the executor and the command&#39;s position.</p><h2 id="new-syntax" tabindex="-1">New Syntax <a class="header-anchor" href="#new-syntax" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Now, let&#39;s take a look at those subcommands. They are as follows:</p><h3 id="execute-as" tabindex="-1"><code>/execute as</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#execute-as" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><div class="language-"><pre><code>/execute as &lt;origin: target&gt; -&gt; execute
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers-wrapper"><span class="line-number">1</span><br></div></div><p>Changes the target of the command, or who @s will select. This does not change the position, rotation, or dimention of the command. If multiple targets are specified, then a command is ran once for each of them, and @s selects each entity in turn.</p><h3 id="execute-at" tabindex="-1"><code>/execute at</code> <a class="header-anchor" href="#execute-at" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><div class="language-"><pre><code>/execute at &lt;origin: target&gt; -&gt; execute
</code></pre><div class="line-numbers-wrapper"><span class="line-number">1</span><br></div></div><p>Changes where the command runs, setting the command&#39;s position and dimension to the entity. This does not change the target of the command, so @s will stay as whoever was targeted last.

Instead, listed here are some common examples of commands.</p><p>The old functionality of <code>/execute</code> can be replicated with <code>as &lt;target&gt; at @s</code>. If you need a positional offset relative to them, add <code>positioned</code>. If you want to detect if a block is present, add <code>if block</code>. Here are some equivalents:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code># Teleport with an offset
/execute @p ~ ~1.62 ~ teleport @s ^ ^ ^3

/execute as @p at @s positioned ~ ~1.62 ~ run teleport @s ^ ^ ^3
