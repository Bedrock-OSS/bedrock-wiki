Because your application can find out through the API where the cursor is on the screen without having to implement its own cursor, this means that Minecraft also uses a lot of Wrappers and they then use the API system directly so that we can see the application.</p><p>Summary: An API is a kind of mutual or one-sided interaction between two or more Applications!</p><h2 id="script-api" tabindex="-1">Script API <a class="header-anchor" href="#script-api" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Maybe you have already heard Script API somewhere, it is important to know what is hidden under this name.</p><p>A lot of people imagine different things like Codes, Scripts, Programming Languages, (<code>Mysterious Experiments in Minecraft? :]</code> ), but in reality it is only, API is not a programming language, script, code, or program, it is a set of functions that allow us to APIs give us the possibility to interact with Minecraft as such, we can receive events, read blocks, entities, create particles, through scripts!
