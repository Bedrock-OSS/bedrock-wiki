## contents.json

`contents.json` is a file located in `RP|BP/contents.json`. This file contains list of **all** files in pack.
Example:

<CodeHeader>RP/contents.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
    "content": [
		{
            "path": "texts/en_US.lang"
        },
		{
			"path": "contents.json"
		},
        {
            "path": "manifest.json"
        },
        {
            "path": "animations/my_animation.animation.json"
        },
        {
            "path": "animation_controllers/my_ac.ac.json"
        },
        {
            "path": "entity/my_entity.entity.json"
        },
        {
            "path": "textures/textures_list.json"
        },
        {
            "path": "textures/blocks/my_block.png"
        },
		"version": 1
    ]
}
```

## What for this file is

This file *probably* optimizes the pack content, making it easier to achieve files for MC, like `texture_list.json`.
Mojang and marketplace content creators use this file.

## Automatizing the Process

«The best contents.json is a contents.json, that is generated by Minecraft»

> @MJ105

That means that you only need to create a contents.json file with empty brackets:

<CodeHeader>BP|RP/contents.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{}
```

Some additional information:

-	Development or normal folders, it don't matter. This file is auto-filled everywhere, even in skin packs (it can crash minecraft when generating it for skin pack).
-	There is no need to make separate contents.json for subpacks. Just make one file in the main folder.
