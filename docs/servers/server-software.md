description: Software for Bedrock servers.
---

Minecraft servers allow players to play online or via a local area network with other people.
[You can download the official Mojang BDS software here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/bedrock).

Alongside the Vanilla BDS offering, many community projects exist, in a variety of languages.
These other projects get seperated into Custom Server Software (Custom) and BDS-Based.

Types of Server Software:
- Custom Server Software = Server Software that is build from completely scratch.
- BDS-Based = Server Software that uses BDS as a base and modifies it.

You might notice that there is a lot of Custom Server Software, compared to BDS-Based ones.
This has plenty of reasons, the biggest being:
- We did not have an official Server Software for a long time, the first Release of BDS was on August 28, 2018... about 7 years after the first release for Bedrock Edition in 2011
- The Symbols (also referred to as Mappings) have first been stripped to reduce the amount of information contained and finally been removed from the game in 1.21.10, due to which a lot of BDS-Based software died

::: tip
Since new software gets created all the time, and old software becomes unmaintained it is always important to update this list.
So if you know a server software that is missing here or know that a server software is no longer maintained, then please update this list and create a PR.

## Further Information

If you want to create your own server software/understand how they work, take a look into the [MCBE Protocol](./bedrock) and [RakNet](./raknet) documentation.
