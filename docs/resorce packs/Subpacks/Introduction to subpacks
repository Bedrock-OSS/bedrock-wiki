//What does this mean: for all the different subpacks you can have different resolutions and or different textures that gets triggered by the cogwheel selector ingame under global packs.
//example I i select my "fancypack" and go to the cogwheel and select 256x resolution the game will copy all the folders from the 256x subpack folder and copy that into the root textures folder.
