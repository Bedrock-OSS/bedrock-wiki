title: Runtime Identifiers
---

`runtime_identifier` is an optional parameter that sits inside the description of the entity's behavior file, and is used to imitate a vanilla entity's hard-coded elements.
It accepts Vanilla Minecraft identifiers, like `minecraft:shulker`.

"within_radius": 1000,

```json
"description": {
    "identifier": "wiki:my_box",
    "is_spawnable": true,
    "is_summonable": true,
    "is_experimental": false,
    "runtime_identifier": "minecraft:shulker"
}
```

It's important to remember that `runtime_identifier` will only parse the hard-coded properties of an entity. This means that using a 100% datadriven mob as the Runtime Identifier will not add any new properties to your entity. Additionally, some entity runtimes may overwrite properties found in datadriven components even if they are added in the components section, such as the collision box size for the shulker entity.

## Known runtime-identifier effects:

-   All runtime ID change name of tamed entity to name of entity which runtime ID it is using

### minecraft:shulker

Perfect for imitating a block, as long as the player is in Adventure Mode.

-   A solid collision box of 1x1x1.
-   The entity will stick to the center of the block it's spawned in.
-   If the block it's attached to is removed, the entity will teleport to another unobstructed location nearby.
-   If the entity is spawned on a non-full block (e.g. bed, slab, etc...), it will teleport to another unobstructed location nearby.
-   The solid collision box's width and height cannot be changed.

-   Any entity killed by the entity will have a wither rose placed where it dies. Strangely, zombies seem to drop the wither rose instead of having it placed at the spot they die at.
-   Makes the entity constantly generate particles(the identifier of the particles it generates is `minecraft:basic_smoke_particle`)
-   Makes the entity unaffected by gravity(this seems to cause entities with `minecraft:projectile` to move in a straight line)
-   Prevents the entity from taking damage
-   only works for entities with no ai goals(so it's only useful for dummy entities and projectiles)

---
