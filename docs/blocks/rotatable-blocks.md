::: tip
This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of blocks and Blockbench.
Ensure to check out the [blocks guide](/blocks/blocks-intro) before starting this tutorial
:::

### First Steps
Make sure you have the `Holiday Creator Features` toggle turned on. This will allow us to utilize the `1.16.100` components.

### The Model

Minecraft uses the default pivot points of [0,0,0]. This means that if your model consits of specific pivot points, your model will look detached in-game. In order to combat this, we can use the blockbench plugin called "Bedrock Pivot Fix 2". This will align your elements to the default pivot point without moving your elements.

### Permutations

Rotating blocks make use of the permutations that were intoduced in 1.16.100. The each permutation contains the `minecraft:rotation` component, and when the condition is true, it will rotate the block to that direction.

```json
{
  "permutations": [
    {
      "condition": "query.block_property('wiki:rotation') == 0",
      "components": {
        "minecraft:rotation": [
          0,
          180,
          0
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "condition": "query.block_property('wiki:rotation') == 1",
      "components": {
        "minecraft:rotation": [
          0,
          0,
          0
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "condition": "query.block_property('wiki:rotation') == 2",
      "components": {
        "minecraft:rotation": [
          0,
          270,
          0
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "condition": "query.block_property('wiki:rotation') == 3",
      "components": {
        "minecraft:rotation": [
          0,
          90,
          0
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Events

In order to make the block rotate the way the player is facing, we have to use some simple molang to query which way the player is facing.

```json
{
  "events": {
    "wiki:set_rotation": {
      "set_block_property": {
        "wiki:rotation": "query.cardinal_facing_2d-2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This event is called upon by using the `minecraft:on_player_placing` component.

```json
{
  "minecraft:on_player_placing": {
    "event": "wiki:set_rotation"
  }
}
```

### The Block Code
