This tutorial assumes an advanced understanding of blocks and scripting.
Check out the [blocks](/blocks/blocks-intro) and [scripting](/scripting/starting-scripts) guides before starting.
:::

The ability to create custom blocks that the player can interact with can be very basic to implement, yet still allow for complex functionality. However, sometimes the default interaction mode, which is based on simply right-clicking or tapping the block without location-specific conditions, is not enough to achieve the desired functionality.

For example, what if you want to create a block that has multiple buttons on one side, and each one triggers a different action? Or a segment display, where multiple individually-lit lamps can be contained within one block.

This is where precise interaction comes in! The following methods of precise interaction allow you to define multiple areas in a block that can be interacted with separately, and assign different functions to each area. In this tutorial, we will show you how to add precise interaction to your blocks using scripts, with examples of each method.

**Note:** Precise interaction does not enable blocks to have multiple/custom-shaped [`minecraft:selection_box`](/blocks/block-components#selection-box) components. The selection box must be within all defined areas for precise interaction to function properly.

## How it Works

The provided methods of precise interaction use `faceLocation`, a property of the [`player interact event`](https://learn.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/minecraft/server/blockcomponentplayerinteractevent?view=minecraft-bedrock-experimental).

This value tells us where on the block's `minecraft:selection_box` was selected/hit, which is what precise interaction relies on.

**Note:** `faceLocation` is _supposed_ to be relative to the bottom north-west corner of the interacted block, however it is currently relative to the world origin, meaning we will have to perform an additional calculation to make it relative. When this issue is resolved, this calculation will no longer be needed.

## FaceSelectionPlains Class

This class allows you to define 2D areas on a block's face and get the selected plain.

To use this method for precise interaction, create the file `BP/scripts/utilities/face_selection_plains.js` and paste the below code into it.

<Spoiler title="FaceSelectionPlains Code">

<CodeHeader>BP/scripts/utilities/face_selection_plains.js</CodeHeader>

```js
import { Direction } from "@minecraft/server";

const isInRange = (value, min, max) => value >= min && value <= max;

export default class FaceSelectionPlains {
    /**
     * Allows you to define 2D areas on a block's face and get the selected plain.
     *
     * @param {Object[]} plains Spread array defining the 2D areas on a block's face which may be selected.

     * @param {string} [plains[].name] Custom name to easily identify this plain when it is selected.

    getSelected(selection, options) {
        const { face, faceLocation } = selection;

        // Create a new object so the original is not mutated
        let location = { ...faceLocation };

        const horizontalAxis = face === Direction.East || face === Direction.West ? "z" : "x";
        const verticalAxis = face === Direction.Up || face === Direction.Down ? "z" : "y";

        if (face !== Direction.Down) location[verticalAxis] = 1 - location[verticalAxis];
        if (face !== Direction.South && face !== Direction.West)

        for (let i = 0; i < this.plains.length; i++) {
            const plain = this.plains[i];

            const inHorizontalRange = isInRange(
                location[horizontalAxis],
                plain.origin[0] / 16,

### Methods

-   #### constructor

    ```ts
    new FaceSelectionPlains(...plains: { origin: [number, number]; size: [number, number]; name?: string }[])
    ```

    Creates a new `FaceSelectionPlains` instance.

    <Spoiler title="Parameters">

    -   **plains**: `Object[]`

        Array defining the 2D areas on a block's face which may be selected.

        -   **origin**: `[number, number]`

            [U, V] array defining the offset of the plain from the top left of the block face.

        -   **size**: `[number, number]`

            [U, V] array defining the size of the plain, extending from the top left.

        -   **name**?: `string`

            Custom name to easily identify this plain when it is selected.

    </Spoiler>

-   #### getSelected

    ```ts
    getSelected(selection: { face: Direction; faceLocation: Vector3 }, options?: { invertU?: boolean; invertV?: boolean }): number | string | undefined
    ```

    Returns the involved plain's array index, or name if provided. If no plain is selected, `undefined` is returned.

    <Spoiler title="Parameters">

    -   **selection**: `Object`

        Object containing details about the selection.

        -   **face**: [`Direction`](https://learn.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/minecraft/server/direction)

            The selected face of the block.

        -   **faceLocation**: [`Vector3`](https://learn.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/minecraft/server/vector3)

            Selection location relative to the bottom north-west corner of the block.

    -   **options**?: `Object`

        Optionally configure how the selected plain is calculated.

        -   **invertU**?: `boolean`

            Horizontal axis goes `right -> left` rather than `left -> right` if true.

        -   **invertV**?: `boolean`

            Vertical axis goes `bottom -> top` rather than `top -> bottom` if true.

    </Spoiler>

### Usage

The below example would split the targeted block face into quarters:

<CodeHeader>BP/scripts/blocks/example.js</CodeHeader>

```js
import { world } from "@minecraft/server";
import FaceSelectionPlains from "../utilities/face_selection_plains";

const quadrants = new FaceSelectionPlains(
    { origin: [0, 0], size: [8, 8] },
    { origin: [8, 0], size: [8, 8] },
    { origin: [0, 8], size: [8, 8] },
    { origin: [8, 8], size: [8, 8] }
);
```

Additionally, names can be provided to easily identify each plain:

```js
const quadrants = new FaceSelectionPlains(
    { origin: [0, 0], size: [8, 8], name: "top_left" },
    { origin: [8, 0], size: [8, 8], name: "top_right" },
    { origin: [0, 8], size: [8, 8], name: "bottom_left" },
    { origin: [8, 8], size: [8, 8], name: "bottom_right" }
);
```

This could be used in a [custom component](/blocks/block-events) to get the selected quadrant:

```js
const QuadrantInteractionBlockComponent = {
    onPlayerInteract({ block, face, faceLocation }) {
        // Work around the faceLocation bug - get the location relative to the block
        const relativeFaceLocation = {
            x: faceLocation.x - block.location.x,
            y: faceLocation.y - block.location.y,
            z: faceLocation.z - block.location.z,
        };

        // Returns the selected area's index (0, 1, 2 or 3), or name if provided (e.g. "top_left").
        // If no plain was selected, `undefined` is retured.
        const selectedQuadrant = quadrants.getSelected({
            face,
            faceLocation: relativeFaceLocation,
        });

        world.sendMessage(`Quadrant ${selectedQuadrant} was selected!`);
    },
};
```

## SelectionBoxes Class

::: warning
As with the `minecraft:selection_box` and `minecraft:collision_box` components, do not use Blockbench's displayed position values when setting up your SelectionBoxes as they are measured from the north-west, rather than the north-east. Instead, use the origin value from the exported `.geo.json` file.

If you wish to use Blockbench's values, the `invertX` option should be set to true in [`getSelected`](#getselected-1).
:::

This class allows you to define 3D areas in a block and get the box which the face selection lies within.

To use this method for precise interaction, create the file `BP/scripts/utilities/selection_boxes.js` and paste the below code into it.

<Spoiler title="SelectionBoxes Code">

<CodeHeader>BP/scripts/utilities/selection_boxes.js</CodeHeader>

    constructor(...boxes) {
        this.boxes = boxes;
    }

     *
     * @param {Object} [options] Optionally configure how the selected box is calculated.
     * @param {boolean} [options.invertX] X axis extends `west -> east` rather than `east -> west` if true, following [Blockbench](https://blockbench.net)'s displayed positions.
     * @param {boolean} [options.invertY] Y axis extends `up -> down` rather than `down -> up` if true.
     * @param {boolean} [options.invertZ] Z axis extends `south -> north` rather than `north -> south` if true.
     *
     * @returns {(string|number|undefined)} Selected box name, or box index if a name is not provided. If no boxes apply to the selection, `undefined` is returned.
     */
    getSelected(faceLocation, options) {
        // Create a new object so the original is not mutated
        let location = { ...faceLocation };

        // X is inverted to ensure measurements are relative to the bottom north-east.
        if (!options?.invertX) location.x = 1 - location.x;
        if (options?.invertY) location.y = 1 - location.y;
        if (options?.invertZ) location.z = 1 - location.z;

        for (let i = 0; i < this.boxes.length; i++) {
            const box = this.boxes[i];

            const from = {
                x: box.origin[0] + 8,
                y: box.origin[1],
                z: box.origin[2] + 8,
            };
            const to = {
                x: from.x + box.size[0],
                y: from.y + box.size[1],
                z: from.z + box.size[2],
            };

            const inXRange = isInRange(location.x, from.x / 16, to.x / 16);
            const inYRange = isInRange(location.y, from.y / 16, to.y / 16);
            const inZRange = isInRange(location.z, from.z / 16, to.z / 16);

        }

    </Spoiler>

### Usage

The below example would split the targeted block into its vertical halves:

<CodeHeader>BP/scripts/blocks/example.js</CodeHeader>

```js
import { world } from "@minecraft/server";
import SelectionBoxes from "../utilities/selection_boxes";

const verticalHalves = new SelectionBoxes(
    { origin: [-8, 8, -8], size: [16, 8, 16], name: "top" },
    { origin: [-8, 0, -8], size: [16, 8, 16], name: "bottom" }
);
```

This could be used with an [`itemUseOn` after event](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/minecraft/server/itemuseonafterevent) to get the selected box:

```js
world.afterEvents.itemUseOn.subscribe((e) => {
    // Do nothing if the targeted block is not "wiki:example_block"
    if (e.block.typeId !== "wiki:example_block") return;

    // Returns the selected vertical half ("top" or "bottom").
    const selectedVerticalHalf = verticalHalves.getSelected(e.faceLocation);

    world.sendMessage(`The ${selectedVerticalHalf} of the block was selected!`);
});
```

## Pigeonholes Example

Using our [FaceSelectionPlains](#faceselectionplains-class) class, we can create a block which functions similarly to a Chiselled Bookshelf. Other assets (textures etc.) are included in the [example pack](#download-example-pack).

Interacting with paper will fill the selected slot. Destroying the block releases all of the stored paper items.

## Double Flower Pot Example

Using our [SelectionBoxes](#selectionboxes-class) class, the player can interact with each pot separately. The following files are the basis for implementing a new Double Flower Pot block, other assets (textures etc.) are included in the [example pack](#download-example-pack).

**Note**: The pots in this example only support the planting of dandelions and cacti for simplicity - you could expand this further yourself.
