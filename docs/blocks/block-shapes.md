title: Block Shapes
---

Blockshapes are essentially block geometries or models that are hard-coded into vanilla, meaning that they exist without having accesible files.

## Application

 They are added in the resource pack's file, `blocks.json`, using child `"blockshape"` in a block's object. This would look something like this:

<CodeHeader></CodeHeader>

```json

    "wiki:invisible_aluminium_ore": {
        "blockshape": "invisible",
        "sound": "stone",
        "textures": "invisible_aluminium_ore"
    }

```

## Known Issues

 Currently, blockshapes do **not** work for custom blocks through the usage of 1 resource pack, it just doesn't work. But by utilising the hierarchy system of active resource packs, you may spread the contents of `blocks.json` over 2 separate resource packs, allowing for blockshapes to be applied.
 
 Example of `blocks.json` from first pack:
 ```json

    "wiki:void_fire": {
        "sound": "stone",
        "textures": "void_fire"
    }

```
 Example of `blocks.json` from second pack:
 ```json

    "wiki:void_fire": {
        "blockshape": "fire"
    }

```
All that is required of the second pack is to contain the information relevent to blockshape of the custom block, so the only required files in the pack are `manifest.json` and `blocks.json`. Then when it comes to applying the addon to your world, make sure to have the second resource pack **above** the first in the hierarchy.
