JavaScript is a well-known scripting language over the internet. Learning JavaScript will be helpful to you to build and develop an add-on with Script API.

You are advised to learn JavaScript free from online courses available online, such as the following:

-   [MDN JavaScript: JavaScript language overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Overview)
-   [Codecademy: Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
-   [freeCodeCamp.org: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)

## Script API Resources

There are somewhat decent amount of resources available online related to script API. Important links have a ⭐.

-   ⭐ [Sample GameTests from Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-gametests) - Sample GameTest behavior files for Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Minecraft supports GameTests - a combination of JavaScript + MCStructures - for validating facets of Minecraft behavior.

-   ⭐ [Official Script API Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/scriptapi/) - Microsoft's official documentation of high-level introduction of experimental Script API

-   [Script API Examples](https://github.com/JaylyDev/ScriptAPI) - JavaScript code snippets that uses Script API modules only

-   [Script API Starter Project](https://github.com/JaylyDev/scriptapi-starter) - A Visual Studio Code workspace setup specifically for Script API. This project is for writing JavaScript code ([for TypeScript users](scripting/typescript#script-api)).

Minecraft Bedrock Edition uses a their own version of JavaScript, which is based on QuickJS. It uses the ECMAScript module (ESM) system for organizing and loading code, which allows for a more modular and organized approach to writing scripts for the game.
