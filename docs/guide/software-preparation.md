Before you can start creating addons, you first have to install the required tools and applications. While development will be easiest on Windows 10, we have provided mobile alternatives for both Android and iOS, where applicable.

### Download Bedrock Minecraft

-   [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/minecraft-for-windows-10/9nblggh2jhxj?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
-   [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en)
-   [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minecraft/id479516143)
-   [Run MC on Linux](https://discord.gg/VJTZ3KaTx6)

## Picking an Editor

Addons can be created using any text editor, however it's much more comfortable to work in a dedicated editor. A good editor can give you code-completion, error-detection, and in-editor documentation.

There are strong opinions about the best editor for beginners, but generally speaking you cannot go wrong selecting either VSCode, or bridge. If you are mobile, you will need to use a mobile alternative.

### VSCode

VSCode is a general purpose text-editor and IDE. With VSCode, you will be able to edit your addons in plain-text, guided along by a powerful array of extensions and addons. VSCode is a great for programmers and advanced users.

[⚙️Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<Spoiler title="Configuring bridge.">

To get started with setting up bridge., check out our [getting started guide](https://bridge-core.app/editor-docs/getting-started/).

Tips when following the guide with bridge.:

-   To create individual files you can open the new file window with `ctrl + n` and look in the `Simple Files` category. The other categories can be used to create multiple files to create a whole block or entity for example.
-   To see your files in a traditional folder structure, disable `PackSpider` in `Settings > General` the settings can be accessed by pressing `ctrl + ,`.

For further guidance on the editor, feel free to contact us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bridgeEditor). bridge. also has an [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/wcRJZN3), where you can hear the latest bridge. news, get help with the editor and extensions and get addon help.
