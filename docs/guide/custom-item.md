This section will walk you through the creation of a simple custom item for our custom entity, the Ghost, to drop. Like blocks and entities, items consist of a BP file (that defines how the item would function/behave) and an RP file (that describes how the item would look)

## Behavior code

Let's start by defining the item's behaviors in the BP. Create a folder called `items` in your BP directory, then create a file called `ectoplasm.json` inside.

<CodeHeader>BP/items/ectoplasm.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"format_version": "1.17",
	"minecraft:item": {
		"description": {
			"identifier": "wiki:ectoplasm",
			"category": "Items"
		},
		"components": {
			"minecraft:icon": {"texture": "wiki.ectoplasm"},
			"minecraft:max_stack_size": 16
		}
	}
}
```

Let's break up the code first:

-   `"format_version"` defines what format the file uses. Weâ€™ll be using 1.17 because that's the current most recent version for items.
-   `"minecraft:item"` contains all of the item's server-side data:
    -   `"identifier"` in `"description"` is a name unique to this item. It should contain no upper-case letters, and `_` should be used instead of spaces. An identifier consists of two parts: a _namespace_ (before the `:`) and the _id_ (after the `:`). The _namespace_ should be the same in all files of the same add-on. Usually, either the author's initials or an abbreviation of the pack name is used as one. In our case, `wiki` is a short enough word to be used as well. The _id_ is the item's own name. All vanilla items use `minecraft` as their namespace, but one CANNOT use that or `minecon` as the namespace in an add-on.
        The most usual way to encounter an identifier is using the `/give` command in-game: for example, to acquire our Ectoplasm, you'd have to type `/give @s wiki:ectoplasm`.
	-   `"category"` in `"description"` defines in which tab of the creative inventory the item would show up. There are four tabs to choose from: `"Nature"`, `"Equipment"`, `"Construction"` and `"Items"`.
    -   `"components"` is where all the data about the item's behavior is stored. There are a lot of different components for items, blocks, and entities each, but since Ectoplasm is very simple, we only need one, which is:
        -   "`minecraft:max_stack_size`" takes an integer (`16` in this case) for its value, but some other components might take JSON objects (`{}`). You can experiment by setting the max stack size value anywhere between 1 and 64. For example, a Diamond Sword would have it as 1, an Ender Pearl as 16.

For more information on components, you can always refer to the documentation on [bedrock.dev/r/Item](https://bedrock.dev/r/Item).

If you were to open a world with the add-on now, the item would already be in-game, but it would be invisible since we haven't defined how it should look yet: let's do it now.

## Item texture and its shortname

### Texture

Navigate to `RP/textures/items/`, creating subdirectories as needed: this is where your item textures will be stored. It's best to name your texture image files with the items' _id_, which is why the texture of Ectoplasm is called `ectoplasm.png`.

`RP/textures/items/ectoplasm.png`

![ectoplasm.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bedrock-OSS/wiki-addon/86b0380310d3d5748a43a4be1f93d4c59668e4bf/guide/guide_RP/textures/items/ectoplasm.png)

### Shortnames

Finally, we need to tell the game that an exact texture file belongs to a specific custom item. In Ectoplasm's RP file, we already defined its icon as `"wiki.ectoplasm"`. Now we have to establish a connection between this _shortname_ and the texture file `ectoplasm.png`
This is done through the `item_texture.json` file, located in `RP/textures/`. Its base code is this:

<CodeHeader>RP/textures/item_texture.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"resource_pack_name": "Ghostly Guide",
	"texture_name": "atlas.items",
	"texture_data": {}
}
```

-   `"resource_pack_name"` is quite self-explanatory: it's the RP name string;
-   `"texture_data"` is an object where each item shortname is defined - for Ectoplasm, we need to pu this code snippet inside of it:

<CodeHeader>RP/textures/item_texture.json/texture_data</CodeHeader>

```json
"wiki.ectoplasm": {
    "textures": "textures/items/ectoplasm"
}
```

This snippet tells the game that by typing `"wiki.ectoplasm"` in our add-on, you mean the _texture_ located in `textures/items/` and called `ectoplasm`. You do not need the `.png` extension here.

After you add the snippet in, `item_texture.json` should look like this:

<CodeHeader>RP/textures/item_texture.json</CodeHeader>

```json
{
	"resource_pack_name": "Ghostly Guide",
	"texture_name": "atlas.items",
	"texture_data": {
		"wiki.ectoplasm": {
			"textures": "textures/items/ectoplasm"
		}
	}
}
```

## Final steps

The last thing to do is to give your item a name to show up in the toolbar. You should already have the text file `RP/texts/en_US.lang`. Add this line to it:

<CodeHeader>RP/texts/en_US.lang</CodeHeader>

```
item.wiki:ectoplasm.name=Ectoplasm
```

## Done!

Now your first custom item, Ectoplasm, is complete! If everything has been done correctly, the item should now be obtainable through the `/give` command in-game, as well as appearing in your creative inventory.

**What are you to do next:**

-   [ ] Create a custom entity;
-   [ ] Create the entity's loot, spawn rules, and a custom recipe;
