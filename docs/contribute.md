Hello there!

Have you spotted a typo? Got stuck following one of our guides? Want to contribute something new? Then you've come to the right place!

## Contributing

The Bedrock wiki is a fully open source project and is maintained by the Bedrock OSS Organization, and our lovely community.

To contribute to our wiki, you don't need to be part of Bedrock OSS. The members of this organization have experience in editing the wiki and can answer your questions at any time. Please join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN) if you want to get in touch.

The Wiki is hosted and edited on GitHub, and we process edits through the pull-request process.

You are more than welcome to directly suggest edits for our approval.

Bedrock OSS is a programming-focused creators discord for Bedrock, where all wiki edits are discussed.

Keeping the style is very important, it allows us to keep guides easy to learn and attractive. Let's write all pages in one style.

Here you can learn how to use special components and style our wiki.
